      <p>
        As of 2020, we have now renounced our Genbu Slayer ways. We now fight
        for the turtles, in hope that they will bring us fortune and luck.
        Please, do not kill turtles. They have feelings, and you're a bully if
        you think otherwise. #Turtles #LiveLoveLaugh #Genburgers
